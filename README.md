# C++ Project Template Generator with CMake

## Overview
This project is a generator for C++ projects using CMake as the build system. It provides a structured template with a preconfigured development environment, supporting multiple platforms and build configurations. The generator helps quickly bootstrap new C++ projects with best practices and standardized settings.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- CMake (minimum version 3.16)
- Python (for script execution if required)

## Usage
```sh
python -m cpp_template
```

This creates a new project folder preconfigured with CMake files and directory structures.
